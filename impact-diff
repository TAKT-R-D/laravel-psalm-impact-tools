# impact-diff - Impact Analysis for Changed PHP Files (Laravel/Psalm)
#
# Summary:
#   This script runs impact analysis (bin/impact) for all changed PHP files (vs a base git ref) in a Laravel project using Psalm.
#   It lists all changed PHP files compared to the specified base, and runs impact on each.
#
# Usage:
#   bin/impact-diff [base-ref]
#     - base-ref: (optional) The git reference to compare against (default: remotes/origin/main)
#
# Example:
#   bin/impact-diff
#   bin/impact-diff main
#
